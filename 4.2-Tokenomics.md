# 4.2 Tokenomics

The $ASSETRA token features a balanced tokenomics model to ensure sustainability. While the total supply is pending finalization, the distribution includes: 40% for public sale and liquidity, 30% for team and advisors, 20% for ecosystem development, and 10% for reserves. This structure supports platform growth, community incentives, and stability. Transaction fees are 0.3% for standard activities and 0.5% for premium services, keeping costs low.

Smart contracts undergo regular audits by leading blockchain security firms, ensuring transparency and trust. The $ASSETRA token powers platform operations, from fee payments to staking rewards, fostering a vibrant ecosystem. As one user noted, “ASSETRA’s robust compliance framework allowed us to tokenize our mining assets with confidence, meeting stringent regulatory standards” (Francisco Javier Gutierrez Maldonado, Consa). The tokenomics align user incentives with platform success, encouraging active participation. For detailed metrics, check ASSETRA’s announcements or the Solana Token Extensions Documentation.
