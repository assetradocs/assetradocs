# 3.3 Listing on the Marketplace

Listing a tokenized asset on ASSETRA’s decentralized marketplace is simple, with tools to enhance visibility. At assetrarwa.com, users create a listing by adding a detailed description, high-quality images, and asset history (e.g., a property’s location or artwork’s provenance). They can set an initial token price or enable auction-style trading. The AI assistant suggests pricing strategies based on market data, ensuring competitive listings.

Users promote their asset using ASSETRA’s social media integration, sharing listings on platforms like Twitter or Discord to reach global investors. Highlighting unique features, such as a property’s rental yield or an artwork’s cultural value, attracts buyers. A dashboard tracks trading volume, revenue, and buyer interest, allowing users to adjust pricing or royalties. Solana’s fast transactions and low fees (0.3–0.5%) ensure cost-effective trading. As one user stated, “ASSETRA has redefined how we approach asset management, making it seamless and inclusive for creators and investors alike” (Anonymous Client). This process makes listing accessible and effective. List your assets at assetrarwa.com.
