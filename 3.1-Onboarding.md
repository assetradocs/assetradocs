# 3.1 Onboarding

Getting started with ASSETRA is straightforward, requiring no technical expertise due to its intuitive design and AI support. Begin by visiting assetrarwa.com and signing up with an email or Solana wallet (e.g., Phantom, Solflare). Complete Know Your Customer (KYC) verification, a mandatory step for regulatory compliance, by submitting identity documents. ASSETRA’s AI verifies these within 24 hours, ensuring a secure onboarding process.

Next, upload asset details through the platform’s secure portal. For example, real estate owners provide property deeds, while artists submit certificates of authenticity. The AI analyzes these documents, verifying ownership and legal status within 24–48 hours. Upon approval, users receive a notification and can proceed to tokenization. For complex assets, ASSETRA’s support team offers personalized guidance, ensuring a smooth experience.

The platform’s user-centric design includes step-by-step prompts and AI recommendations, making it accessible to beginners. As one client shared, “ASSETRA’s robust compliance framework allowed us to tokenize our mining assets with confidence, meeting stringent regulatory standards” (Francisco Javier Gutierrez Maldonado, Consa).
