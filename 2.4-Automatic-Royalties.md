# 2.4 Automatic Royalties

ASSETRA’s automatic royalty system delivers passive income to token holders, enhancing the appeal of tokenized assets. When assets like real estate or intellectual property generate revenue (e.g., rent, licensing fees), smart contracts distribute profits to token holders based on their ownership share. For example, a tokenized property earning $10,000 monthly would pay $1,000 to a 10% token holder, minus platform fees (0.3–0.5%). This process is fully automated, leveraging Solana’s blockchain for transparent, auditable payouts.

Asset owners set royalty rates during tokenization, balancing returns for themselves and investors. Transparent distribution logs ensure trust. The system supports various assets, from rental properties to music royalties, offering flexibility. ASSETRA’s AI assistant optimizes royalty structures based on market trends, ensuring competitive yields. As one user noted, “ASSETRA’s platform has opened up real estate investment to a global audience, making it possible for small-scale investors to own a piece of prime property” (Dyma Bodurin, Hacken Group). This feature makes ASSETRA a powerful tool for passive income generation. Learn more at assetrarwa.com.
