# 3.2 Token Setup

After asset verification, users customize their tokenized asset’s parameters using ASSETRA’s intuitive interface. The AI assistant guides this process, ensuring optimal settings without technical expertise. Key parameters include:

- **Token Supply:** Set the number of tokens (e.g., 1,000 tokens for a $1M property = $1,000/token).
- **Ownership Shares:** Define fractional ownership percentages.
- **Royalty Rates:** Establish revenue distribution (e.g., 70% to token holders, 30% to the owner).
- **Lock Periods:** Optional trading restrictions to stabilize value.

The AI suggests settings based on market trends and asset type, such as higher royalties for stable-income properties. Smart contracts are generated automatically, embedding parameters on Solana’s blockchain for transparency and security. Users can review and adjust settings before finalizing. As one testimonial notes, “The AI-powered verification process gave us confidence in tokenizing our intellectual property, streamlining a complex process into a few clicks” (Guillermo Malo de Molina, Innovation Smart District). This streamlined setup empowers users to create tailored tokens effortlessly. Configure your tokens at assetrarwa.com.
