# Core Concepts

## Tokenization of AI Agents

Tokenization transforms an AI agent—whether it is a chatbot, predictive model, or workflow engine—into a digital token on a blockchain. By minting an **NFT** or fungible token representing the agent’s code, metadata, and performance metrics, developers assign a unique **economic identity** to their digital solution. This identity captures versioning, usage rights, and revenue rules, enabling transparent tracking of ownership and provenance. Investors can acquire tokens in secondary markets, providing liquidity and price discovery for AI-driven innovations. Additionally, token holders may receive a share of generated revenue, aligning incentives and fostering community engagement.

## RWA Platform

As a Real-World Asset (RWA) platform, ASSETRA bridges the gap between autonomous digital tools and traditional finance. It provides infrastructure for token issuance, secure custody, and decentralized governance. Through EVM-compatible smart contracts, ASSETRA ensures compatibility with major wallets, exchanges, and DeFi protocols. Enterprises can onboard their workflow automations by defining clear asset attributes—such as revenue streams and subscription models—into token metadata. Automated oracles feed performance data on-chain, while a modular contract architecture supports upgrades and compliance overlays, making tokenized agents viable for institutional adoption.

## Economic Identity

Economic identity encapsulates the financial and governance rules of a tokenized agent. By leveraging NFT standards (e.g., ERC-721) or fungible tokens (ERC-20), ASSETRA enables flexible profit-sharing models. Smart contracts define revenue-splitting logic, vesting schedules, and governance rights for contributors. Token holders can vote on upgrades, allocate budget for improvements, or adjust fee structures. This on-chain framework abstracts away complex legal agreements, codifying obligations directly into the asset’s logic. Economic identity thus becomes the cornerstone of decentralized ownership, driving alignment between creators, investors, and users.

## Digital Productivity Scaling

Decentralized ownership of AI agents accelerates digital productivity scaling. When communities co-invest in high-performance workflows, resources pool together, and agents evolve faster through stakeholder-driven funding. Revenue generated by tokenized tools flows back to token holders, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem. Use cases span from marketing automation bots to supply-chain optimization engines. By fractionalizing access, ASSETRA democratizes cutting-edge productivity tools, enabling startups and enterprises alike to harness collective intelligence and scale operations more efficiently.
