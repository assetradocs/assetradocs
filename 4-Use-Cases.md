# Use Cases

## AI Chatbots as Tradable Assets

Tokenized chatbots encapsulate conversational AI models and deployment configurations into on-chain assets. Businesses can sell or lease bot tokens, granting access to customer support or virtual assistant services. Secondary markets enable dynamic pricing based on usage metrics, while royalty mechanisms ensure creators earn fees on each transaction. This model unlocks a new revenue stream for intelligent agents and democratizes access to advanced NLP capabilities.

## Predictive Algorithms in DeFi

By tokenizing predictive trading algorithms, investors gain fractional exposure to AI-driven strategies without direct code ownership. Performance oracles feed real-time profit and loss data, triggering smart contracts to adjust rewards and fees. Token holders share in strategy gains, and governance tokens allow community oversight of risk parameters. This fusion of AI and DeFi delivers transparent, algorithmic investment products.

## Workflow Automation Tokens

Complex automation pipelines—such as invoice processing, data ETL, or supply-chain triggers—become tokenized assets that enterprises and freelancers can invest in collaboratively. Tokens grant execution rights and revenue shares, aligning incentives between developers and end-users. As pipelines evolve, stakeholders vote on enhancements through governance proposals, fueling continuous improvement in operational efficiency.
